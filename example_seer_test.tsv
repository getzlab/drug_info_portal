BRCA genes are involved with repairing damaged DNA and normally work to prevent tumor development. However, mutations of these genes may lead to certain cancers, including ovarian cancers. Rubraca is a poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor that blocks an enzyme involved in repairing damaged DNA. By blocking this enzyme, DNA inside the cancerous cells with damaged BRCA genes may be less likely to be repaired, leading to cell death and possibly a slow-down or stoppage of tumor growth."

This is the first FDA approval for treatment of newly diagnosed PTCL, and the agency used a new review program to complete the approval more quickly.  November 9, 2017: FDA granted regular approval to brentuximab vedotin for the treatment of adult patients with primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) or CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides (MF) who have received prior systemic therapy.   The FDA approved brentuximab vedotin, brand name Adcetris, for the treatment of HL (Hodgkin lymphoma) and ALCL (systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma). Adcetris consists of a drug and an antibody: an antibody-drug conjugate. The antibody directs the drug to CD30, a target on lymphoma cells. Adectris was approved under the FDA's accelerated approval program. Adcetris is designed for individuals whose Hodgkin lymphoma continued to progress after autologous stem cell transplant, or after two previous treatments with chemotherapy and the patient cannot receive a transplant. Adectris can also be prescribed for individuals whose ALCL has progressed after one treatment with chemotherapy.   March 20, 2018: FDA  approved brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris) to treat adult patients with previously untreated stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) in combination with chemotherapy."
